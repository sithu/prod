/**
 * Routes
 *
 * Your routes map URLs to views and controllers.
 * 
 * If Sails receives a URL that doesn't match any of the routes below,
 * it will check for matching files (images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) 
 * in your assets directory.  e.g. `http://localhost:1337/images/foo.jpg` 
 * might match an image file: `/assets/images/foo.jpg`
 *
 * Finally, if those don't match either, the default 404 handler is triggered.
 * See `config/404.js` to adjust your app's 404 logic.
 *
 * Note: Sails doesn't ACTUALLY serve stuff from `assets`-- the default Gruntfile in Sails copies
 * flat files from `assets` to `.tmp/public`.  This allows you to do things like compile LESS or 
 * CoffeeScript for the front-end.
 *
 * For more information on routes, check out:
 * http://sailsjs.org/#documentation

  // default view engine) your home page.
  // 
  // (Alternatively, remove this and add an `index.html` file in your `assets` directory)
  '/': {
    view: 'homepage'

// By default, your root route (aka home page) points to a view
  // located at `views/home/index.ejs`
  // 
  // (This would also work if you had a file at: `/views/home.ejs`)

  /*
  // But what if you want your home page to display
  // a signup form located at `views/user/signup.ejs`?
  '/': {
    view: 'user/signup'
  }


  // Let's say you're building an email client, like Gmail
  // You might want your home route to serve an interface using custom logic.
  // In this scenario, you have a custom controller `MessageController`
  // with an `inbox` action.
  '/': 'MessageController.inbox'


  // Alternatively, you can use the more verbose syntax:
  '/': {
    controller: 'MessageController',
    action: 'inbox'
  }


  // If you decided to call your action `index` instead of `inbox`,
  // since the `index` action is the default, you can shortcut even further to:
  '/': 'MessageController'


  // Up until now, we haven't specified a specific HTTP method/verb
  // The routes above will apply to ALL verbs!
  // If you want to set up a route only for one in particular
  // (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), just specify the verb before the path.
  // For example, if you have a `UserController` with a `signup` action,
  // and somewhere else, you're serving a signup form looks like: 
  //
  //    <form action="/signup">
  //      <input name="username" type="text"/>
  //      <input name="password" type="password"/>
  //      <input type="submit"/>
  //    </form>

  // You would want to define the following route to handle your form:
  'post /signup': 'UserController.signup'


  // What about the ever-popular "vanity URLs" aka URL slugs?
  // (you might remember doing this with `mod_rewrite` in Apache)
  //
  // This is where you want to set up root-relative dynamic routes like:
  // http://yourwebsite.com/twinkletoez
  //
  // NOTE:
  // You'll still want to allow requests through to the static assets,
  // so we need to set up this route to ignore URLs that have a trailing ".":
  // (e.g. your javascript, CSS, and image files)
  'get /*(^.*)': 'UserController.profile'
